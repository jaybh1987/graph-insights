  Hello, Good Morning.
  I hope you are doing well. 
  I applied for the test yesterday and want to share my thoughts. 
  
  
  Thoughts: 
  Many times companies following some specific procedures to hire the employees. 
  Each domain in IT is very vast and also not possible to fit everything in our head.
  Therefore, my test was not so good. 
  Following is my suggestion please never mind. 
  
  Suggestion: 
  Asking some questions and judging employees on that basis is not a good idea.
  I would recommand companies should give some task to the candidates with a timeline to complete it. 
  This task should include the techonology and procedures which company is following. 
  Company should analyse the approach of candidate towards solving the problem. 
  
  In addition, company should consider the curiosity of candidate to learn and adopt new things.
