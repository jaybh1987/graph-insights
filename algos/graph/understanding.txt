Graph is a data structure where a node can have zero or more adjacent elements.

Connection between two nodes is called edge.
Nodes can also called vertices.
degree is the number of adges connected to a vertex.

if the edges are bi-directional, then we have undirected graph.
if the edges have the direction, then we have directed graph or di-graph for short.

vertex can have edges that go to itself. this is called self loop.


Cyclic Graph:
  A graph can have cycles. Which means you could get the same node more than once.

Acyclic Graph:
  The graph without cycles is called acyclic graph.
  Acyclic undirected graphs are called tree.

Not all vertices have to be connected in the graph.
You might have isolated nodes or even seperated subgraphs.

All nodes have atleast 1 edge. then we have connected graph.
When all nodes are connected to all other nodes, then we have a complete graph.


There is 2 primary ways of representing graph.
  Adjacency list
  Adjacency Matrix.



Adjacency matrix:
  This is a way of representing graph using two-dimensional array (N * N matrix)
