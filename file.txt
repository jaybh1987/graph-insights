Break existing tcp connections to s3 buckets require reconnecting to interact with s3.

Currently pods, lamddas and other service pull data from S3 by using S3 endpoints via NAT gateways. 

Implement VPC endpoint for an S3 gateway. This new endpoint will route traffic desined for s3 buckets through private IPs directly to aws's s3 service 
instead of sending traffic out our NAT gateways.
